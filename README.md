Love your errors

A saturday morning tribute to the work of Esteban and friends.

To install:
```
cargo install cargo-errorbook
```

Then when you get some fun errors, run:

```
cargo errorbook clippy
```
or
```
cargo errorbook check
```

and bind them into a nice searchable collector's edition book for posterity.
